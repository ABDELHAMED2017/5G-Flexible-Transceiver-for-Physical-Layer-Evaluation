# 5G-Flexible-Transceiver-for-Physical-Layer-Evaluation
The aim of this proposal is to extend the flexible PHY software component made available
by the eWINE project with MIMO technologies. The goal is to utilize the second independent RF
chain of the USRP SDR to employ Alamouti space-time coding (STC) combined with GFDM. This
technique, firstly introduced for OFDM based wireless transmission systems, increases the reliability
of the data transfer by transmitting multiply copies of the data stream. However, it has not yet been
applied on the GFDM flexible waveform generation framework and, since GFDM is a nonorthogonal
waveform, its combination with STC is not a straight forward approach.
